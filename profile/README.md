# Computational transcriptomics in neurodevelopment

Welcome to the HamidLab GitHub page!

Our lab is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal development by developing sophisticated computational methods that employ cross-disciplinary AI/ML and advanced statistical approaches. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we study how post-transcriptional mechanisms tightly regulate the expression and functional outputs of lineage-specific neuronal genes.

We also form part of the Bioinformatics Core team at the Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, designed to facilitate the processing and the analysis of high-throughput “omics” and functional imaging data.
