# Computational transcriptomics in neurodevelopment

Welcome to the HamidLab GitHub account.

Our lab is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal development by developing sophisticated computational methods that employ cross-disciplinary AI/ML and advanced statistical approaches. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we study how post-transcriptional mechanisms tightly regulate the expression and functional outputs of lineage-specific neuronal genes.
